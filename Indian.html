    <p style ="font-size:23px;">Butter chicken or murgh makhani is a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato, butter and cream sauce. It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry. In my opinion it is best paired with Naan, which I will talk about later. Butter Chicken is one of my favouite Indian foods, simply because of the curry.</p>
    
    <h2>Biryani</h2>
    <img src="Mutton_Biryani.jpg" alt ="Butter Chicken" width=30% style="float:left;padding:10px;border-radius:20px;">
    <p style ="font-size:23px;">Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with Indian spices, rice, and meat usually that of chicken, goat, lamb, prawn, fish, and sometimes, in addition, eggs or vegetables such as potatoes in certain regional varieties. I love Biryani, because of how spicy it is, and the variety of ingredients you can make it with. My favorite Biryani is mutton Biryani.</p>
