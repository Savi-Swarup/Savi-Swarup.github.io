    <h3 style="font-size:23px;font-weight:1;">Hi! I'm Savi, a 14-year-old boy who lives in Singapore. Welcome to my website. It's about food around the world. I have been to many places, so this website shows some of my favorite food from my favorite places. This includes, the US, India, Italy, and Japan. I decided to make my website about food because I felt hungry. If you're vegetarin or have some sort of allergy I apologise since most of my reccomendations contain meat. I hope after reading my website, you decide to try some of these foods. Bye!</h3>
