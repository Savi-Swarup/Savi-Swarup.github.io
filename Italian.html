  <p style ="font-size:23px;">Pizza is one of my favorite foods. Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. Personally, I prefer Pizza with peperoni on top. </p>

  <h2>Pasta</h2>

  <p style ="font-size:23px;">Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. My favorite type of pasta is bologenese pasta, because I feel like the flavours compliment each other nicely.</p>
